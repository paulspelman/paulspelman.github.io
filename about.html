        <p>This is the part where I write about myself which always feels a little bit embarrassing. To prepare, I've spent many hours studying 
          the art of agressive self-promotion by browsing LinkedIn. Here we go...</p>

        <p>I started out as a copywriter in New Zealand where there is only one advertising agency and two clients. We worked late into the 
          night, taking turns writing up our best ideas with the agency pen, then eventually drifting off into a peaceful slumber under our 
          desks. After overhearing someone say that there were more exciting countries out there beyond New Zealand, I moved to Australia and 
          immediately realized that this wasn't what they were talking about.</p>

        <p>A few years later I arrived in New York after winning the green card lottery, which is the world's greatest immigration system. I'd never 
          actually been to the U.S. before, but I decided to move to NYC with nothing but two suitcases and a dream. The dream was to own three suitcases, 
          and eventually that dream came true.</p>

        <p>Here are some things I can do - come up with great ideas, execute them really well, help other creatives make their ideas better, 
          manage and mentor creative teams, sell work to clients, pitch and win new business, win awards, and cut my own hair.</p>

        <p>Here are some things I can't do - a good American accent, tolerate anything with onions on it, understand the need for leaf blowers, accept 
          that anyone in the NBA is a better player than New Zealand's favorite son Steven Adams.</p>
