      <div class="copy-project"><p>Mr Pizza is Koreaâ€™s largest pizza chain, and it had plans to expand into the US market. To get people talking about a Korean pizza chain, we decided to position Mr Pizza as the absolute experts in pizza, bar none.</p><p>We created a documentary that explored our made-up theory that pizza was actually invented in Korea, and stolen by the Italian explorer Marco Polo in the 13th century. To add authenticity, we invented a fake historian, an archaeologist, a culinary expert, a Buddhist scholar, an ancient folk song, a conspiracy theory blogger, a Chinese ambassador, and we even included the real CEO of Mr Pizza.</p><p>Silver Pencil at The One Show, Bronze Lion at Cannes.</p></div>
